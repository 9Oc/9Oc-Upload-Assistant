## This is just a template file. Replace with your own values and rename to user-args.json
## Currently only tmdb_id is supported, and this file is parsed after metadata processing
## Changing category or season or episode for instance, is ill advised as these are used in metadata processing
## Not throughly tested, for args try using a list instead of a string or vice versa if you encounter issues
